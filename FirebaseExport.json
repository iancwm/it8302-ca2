They produce research reports, projections, and recommendations concerning companies and stocks. Typically, an equity analyst specializes in a small group of companies in a particular industry or country to develop the high-level expertise necessary to produce accurate projections and recommendations.\n\nThese analysts monitor market data and news reports and speak to contacts in the companies and industries they study to update their research daily.","credit_analyst":"Assessing many different risk factors encompasses collecting a large amount of financial information. Credit analysts compile these financial records and make wise recommendations on whether or not to extend credit. Objective financial analysis is the hallmark quality of successful credit analysts, particularly analysts employed at large global financial institutions. Credit analysts combine the intricacies of financial statements with current financial market conditions. Given the instability in the global economy as a whole, opportunities for employment as a credit analyst are in very high demand as companies large and small look for ways to remain profitable. Providing companies and investors with the financial analysis necessary to make shrewd business choices gives credit analysts ample opportunity to earn very lucrative performance-based bonuses as a result.","investment_banker":"An investment banker is someone who works in a financial institution or in a large bank's division that is involved in raising capital for governments, companies and other entities. They raise money by issuing and selling securities in the primary market and assist public and private corporations in raising funds in the capital markets (both debt and equity). They may also provide strategic advice to their clients on specific transactions such as mergers and acquisitions and other types of financial transactions.","private_equity":"Private equity, at its most basic, is equity (i.e. shares representing ownership) in an entity that is not publicly listed or traded. Private equity is a source of investment capital that comes from high net worth individuals and firms. These investors buy shares of private companies\u2014or gain control of public companies with the intention of taking them private and ultimately delisting them from public stock exchanges. Large institutional investors dominate the private equity world, including pension funds and large private equity firms funded by a group of accredited investors.","corporate_banker":"As a corporate banker, you\u2019ll be like the hub in a wheel for clients who need to access the bank\u2019s products and services. Your job is to get the other areas of the bank, such as markets, treasury, trade, transactions, and debt capital markets, to assist with deal execution. These deals are usually credit-related, but there\u2019s a lot more to it than traditional loans. For example, the corporate banking division also offers cash management (collecting cash and managing changes in foreign exchange rates) and trade finance (e.g., factoring and export credit and insurance) services.","risk_manager":"A risk management specialist is someone who is responsible for keeping a business on its feet and bringing in profits. Risk management specialists are financial managers that use specific training, skills and experience to identify possible risks that could result in lower cash flow and higher insurance rates for the business. These specialists assess risks and implement plans and strategies to minimize business losses. Lowering loss also lowers the cost of insurance, resulting in greater revenue flow for the business.","sales_trading":"Sales and Trading (S&T) is a group at an investment bank that consists of salespeople who call institutional investors with ideas and opportunities, and traders who execute orders and advise clients on entering and exiting financial positions. Sales and trading is the lifeblood that makes or breaks an investment securities firm, be it a stock brokerage, a hedge fund, or an investment bank. If the firm can\u2019t successfully sell its services to clients, then it is unable to do business \u2013 and if it can\u2019t trade well, then it becomes difficult for the firm to obtain and keep clients and to make money.","private_banker":"Private banking involves providing banking, investment, tax management, and other financial services to high net worth individuals (HNWIs). Unlike mass-market retail banking, private banking focuses on providing more personalized financial services to its clients, through banking personnel specifically dedicated to providing such individual services. HNWIs possess more wealth than the average person, and they are, therefore. capable of accessing a much larger variety of investments, such as hedge funds and real estate. Private banking offers clients information and advice regarding what may be the most appropriate investment options for them.","quant":"Quantitative analysts (also called \u201cquants\u201d) are professionals specializing in the design, development, and implementation of algorithms and mathematical or statistical models intended to solve complex financial problems. In their work, quantitative analysts apply a blend of techniques and knowledge from multiple disciplines including finance, economics, mathematics, statistics, and computer science."},"link":{"equity_research":"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/articles\/professionals\/120815\/equity-research-career-path-and-qualifications.asp","credit_analyst":"https:\/\/www.careerexplorer.com\/careers\/credit-analyst\/","investment_banker":"https:\/\/www.careerexplorer.com\/careers\/investment-banker\/","private_equity":"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/ask\/answers\/041315\/what-are-major-differences-between-investment-banking-and-private-equity.asp","corporate_banker":"https:\/\/www.mergersandinquisitions.com\/corporate-banking\/","risk_manager":"https:\/\/www.careerexplorer.com\/careers\/risk-management-specialist\/","sales_trading":"https:\/\/corporatefinanceinstitute.com\/resources\/careers\/jobs\/sales-and-trading\/","private_banker":"https:\/\/corporatefinanceinstitute.com\/resources\/careers\/jobs\/private-banking\/","quant":"https:\/\/corporatefinanceinstitute.com\/resources\/careers\/jobs\/quants\/"}}
